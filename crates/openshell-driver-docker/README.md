# openshell-driver-docker

Docker-backed compute driver for local OpenShell gateways.

When the gateway configures `[openshell.gateway.otlp]`, Docker compute-driver
spans export to the same OTLP/gRPC collector with the service name
`openshell-driver-docker`. The in-process driver preserves the gateway trace
context and emits the compute-driver RPC boundary that a standalone driver
would expose.

`mise run gateway:docker` enables this export only when a local collector is
listening on `127.0.0.1:4317`. Otherwise, it omits the gateway OTLP configuration
so the development gateway does not repeatedly report export failures.

The standalone `openshell-driver-docker` binary accepts
`OPENSHELL_OTLP_ENDPOINT`. When set, it exports Docker driver spans to that
collector, continues W3C trace context from gateway RPC metadata, and flushes
spans during graceful shutdown.

The driver manages sandbox containers through the local Docker daemon with the
`bollard` client. It is intended for developer environments where Docker is
already available and running Kubernetes would be unnecessary.

The driver connects to `[openshell.drivers.docker].socket_path` when configured.
Otherwise, it uses the first standard local Docker socket that responds to an
API ping, which is the same selection mechanism used by gateway auto-detection.
An explicitly selected Docker driver falls back to `/var/run/docker.sock` when
no candidate responds.

## Runtime Model

The gateway runs as a host process. The Docker driver creates one container per
sandbox and starts the `openshell-sandbox` supervisor inside that container. The
supervisor then creates the nested sandbox namespace for the agent process.

## Stop and Start

Stop stops the managed container without removing it. Docker retains the
container writable layer, attached volumes, labels, token material, and restart
policy. Start starts that same container, so files in the resolved OCI
workspace remain available. A durably stopped sandbox is excluded from
gateway startup recovery and stays stopped across gateway restarts. Delete
continues to force-remove the container and clean up driver-owned material.
Graceful gateway shutdown sends `StopSandbox` for each sandbox whose persisted
phase requires running compute without changing that persisted intent. On
startup, the gateway sends an idempotent `StartSandbox` request for the same
sandboxes, restarting their retained containers. Explicitly stopped sandboxes
remain excluded.

Before creating the container, the driver inspects the final sandbox image and
captures its immutable image ID, raw OCI `Config.User`, and OCI
`Config.WorkingDir`. Container creation uses that image ID, preventing a
mutable tag from changing between inspection and launch. The supervisor runs as
root, resolves omitted policy identity fields from the image declaration, and
drops only agent children to the resulting identity. Named OCI components
remain names after validation; a missing group is filled with the user's
numeric primary GID. Explicit `process.run_as_user` and
`process.run_as_group` values take precedence independently.

An absolute OCI working directory becomes the agent workspace. An empty,
root (`/`), or explicit `/sandbox` declaration uses `/sandbox`, which OpenShell
creates when necessary and owns as a compatibility workspace. Any other image
workdir must already exist without symlink components. The completed identity,
including supplementary groups, must already be able to traverse every parent
and write and enter the workdir. OpenShell does not change its ownership or
mode.

OpenShell deliberately asks the Linux kernel to make this access decision
under the completed sandbox identity instead of reproducing permission rules
from ownership and mode bits. Mode-bit inspection alone can reject authority
granted by a POSIX ACL or overlook a denial imposed by a Linux Security Module
such as SELinux or AppArmor. OpenShell does not configure or otherwise manage
ACLs or LSM policy here; the one-shot validator only observes the kernel's
effective decision. This keeps the no-authority-expansion invariant aligned
with the access the eventual workload will receive without adding a separate,
incomplete permission model to OpenShell.

Image `VOLUME` declarations must not cover the workdir or one of its parents
because Docker would mount the volume before the supervisor could validate the
immutable image path.
Workdirs under the standard OCI runtime namespaces `/proc`, `/sys`, and `/dev`
are rejected, as are paths that overlap concrete OpenShell control resources.
The workspace is the child cwd and `HOME`. The supervisor starts from `/`, then
reports an invalid workdir as a readiness failure.

Docker containers join an OpenShell-managed bridge network. The driver injects
`host.openshell.internal` and `host.docker.internal` so supervisors have stable
names for reaching the gateway host. On Docker Desktop, Colima, Rancher
Desktop, OrbStack, and macOS-hosted gateways, those names use Docker's
`host-gateway` alias. The driver requests a separate IPv4 loopback callback
listener when the primary listener does not already cover it. On native Linux
Docker, the gateway also binds the bridge gateway IP so containers can call
back to the host process.

## Container Contract

The driver-controlled container settings are part of the sandbox security
contract:

| Setting | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `user = "0"` | The supervisor needs root inside the container to prepare namespaces, mounts, Landlock, and seccomp. |
| `network_mode = openshell` | Places the supervisor on the managed Docker bridge network. |
| `cap_add` | Grants supervisor-only capabilities required for namespace setup and process inspection. |
| `apparmor=unconfined` | Avoids Docker's default profile blocking required mount operations. |
| `restart_policy = no` | A canonical main-process exit remains terminal and is not silently restarted by Docker. |
| `PidsLimit` | Enforces the sandbox PID budget at the Docker cgroup layer. Set `[openshell.drivers.docker].sandbox_pids_limit = 0` to inherit the Docker/runtime default. |
| CDI GPU request | Uses opaque `driver_config.cdi_devices` values when set; otherwise selects the requested count of NVIDIA CDI GPUs in round-robin order when daemon CDI support is detected. Docker daemon `/info` can permit `nvidia.com/gpu=all` as a WSL2 all-only compatibility fallback, where it counts as one selectable device. Exact CDI device lists must not contain duplicates and must match the effective GPU count. |
| `policy-dns-transparent-tcp` capability | Declares that the combined Docker supervisor can own namespace-local DNS/TCP capture and coupled workload restart. The shared supervisor still owns DNS eligibility, mappings, authorization, pinned dialing, relaying, and OCSF decisions. The marker is stripped from the workload environment. |

The agent child process does not retain these supervisor privileges.

## Driver Config Mounts

The gateway forwards the `docker` block from `--driver-config-json` to this
driver. The driver accepts user-supplied `mounts` entries with these Docker
mount types:

- `bind`: mounts an absolute host path when `[openshell.drivers.docker]`
  has `enable_bind_mounts = true`.
- `volume`: mounts an existing Docker named volume. The driver validates that
  the volume exists before provisioning and never creates or removes it.
  Docker local-driver volumes created with bind options are treated as host
  bind mounts and require `enable_bind_mounts = true`.
- `tmpfs`: mounts an in-memory filesystem with optional `options`,
  `size_bytes`, and `mode`.

Host bind mounts are disabled by default because they expose gateway host
paths to sandbox requests. Image mounts are not part of the Docker
driver-config schema. The driver still uses internal bind mounts for
OpenShell-owned supervisor, token, and TLS material.

Docker `bind` mounts accept `source`, `target`, optional `read_only`, and an
optional `selinux_label` of `shared` (applies `:z`) or `private` (applies
`:Z`) for SELinux-enforcing hosts. Docker `volume` mounts may include
`subpath`. User-supplied bind and volume mounts are read-only by default; set
`read_only: false` to make them writable. Mount `source`, `target`, and
`subpath` values must not contain surrounding whitespace. Mount targets must be
absolute container paths and must not replace or contain the resolved workspace
root. Nested workspace mounts remain valid. Mounts also must not overlap the
configured SSH socket or the reserved `/opt/openshell`, `/etc/openshell`,
`/etc/openshell-tls`, `/run/openshell`, `/run/openshell-sidecar`, and network
namespace roots.

Example named-volume usage:

```shell
docker volume create openshell-work

openshell sandbox create \
  --driver-config-json '{"docker":{"mounts":[{"type":"volume","source":"openshell-work","target":"/sandbox/work"}]}}' \
  -- claude
```

## Supervisor Binary Resolution

The Docker driver bind-mounts a host-side Linux `openshell-sandbox` binary into
each sandbox container. Resolution order is:

1. `supervisor_bin` in `[openshell.drivers.docker]`.
2. `supervisor_image` in `[openshell.drivers.docker]`, extracting
   `/openshell-sandbox` from that image.
3. A sibling `openshell-sandbox` next to the running `openshell-gateway` binary.
4. A local Linux cargo target build for the Docker daemon architecture.
5. The release-matched default supervisor image, extracting `/openshell-sandbox`.

Release and Docker-image gateway builds bake the matching supervisor image tag
into the binary at compile time. The default Docker supervisor image is not
`:latest` unless a custom build explicitly sets that tag.

## Callback and TLS

`OPENSHELL_ENDPOINT` is injected from the gateway's configured gRPC endpoint.
When no endpoint is configured, the driver uses
`host.openshell.internal:<gateway-port>` with the appropriate HTTP or HTTPS
scheme. Set `host_gateway_ip` only when the host has an explicit, locally
assigned address that containers should use for callbacks; package-managed
macOS gateways should leave it unset.

For HTTPS endpoints, the server certificate must include the endpoint host as a
subject alternative name. Docker sandboxes also need the client TLS bundle
mounted into the container and exposed with:

- `OPENSHELL_TLS_CA`
- `OPENSHELL_TLS_CERT`
- `OPENSHELL_TLS_KEY`

HTTP endpoints reject TLS material because the supervisor would not use it.

## Environment Ownership

The driver merges template environment and sandbox spec environment first, then
overwrites security-critical keys:

- `OPENSHELL_ENDPOINT`
- `OPENSHELL_SANDBOX_ID`
- `OPENSHELL_SANDBOX`
- `OPENSHELL_SSH_SOCKET_PATH`
- `OPENSHELL_MAIN_PROCESS_SPEC`
- TLS path variables when HTTPS is enabled

Do not allow sandbox images or templates to override these values.
