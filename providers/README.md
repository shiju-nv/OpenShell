# Example provider profiles

These files are reviewable examples. OpenShell does not compile them into any
binary and no gateway loads them on its own: a gateway's profile catalog
contains exactly what an operator imported.

Import one at platform scope:

```shell
openshell provider profile lint   -f providers/github.yaml
openshell provider profile import -f providers/github.yaml --global
```

Or import the whole directory:

```shell
openshell provider profile import --from providers --global
```

Drop `--global` to import into the current workspace instead.

## Read the header before importing

Every file opens with a comment block naming its expected client binaries, the
image layout those paths assume, the credential scope, the endpoint access it
grants, and a smoke test. Read it. A profile's `binaries` list is the control
that decides which processes may reach its endpoints, and several of these
examples name paths that only exist in the OpenShell Community image
(`/sandbox/.venv`, `/app/.venv`, `/sandbox/.cursor-server`,
`/usr/lib/node_modules/...`). Imported unchanged into a different image, such a
profile matches nothing: the catalog still advertises it, but the credential is
never injected and the traffic is denied.

Copy the file, edit `binaries` and `endpoints` to match your image and your
workload, and import your copy.

## Adapting one

- Give your copy a distinct `id` if it diverges from the example, so the two
  cannot be confused in the catalog.
- Keep `binaries` as narrow as the workload allows. Widening it to match every
  image trades away the binary-scoped least privilege that makes credential
  injection safe.
- Keep `endpoints` limited to the hosts the credential should reach. A
  credential is only sent to the endpoints its profile declares.
- Run `openshell provider profile lint` before importing.

See [Provider profiles](https://docs.nvidia.com/openshell/latest/providers/profiles.html) for the
full schema.
