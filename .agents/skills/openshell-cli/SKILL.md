# OpenShell CLI

Guide agents through using the `openshell` CLI for sandbox and platform management -- from basic operations to advanced multi-step workflows.

## Overview

The OpenShell CLI (`openshell`) is the primary interface for managing sandboxes, providers, policies, settings, exposed services, inference routes, and gateway registrations. Gateway service lifecycle is handled outside the CLI by packages, systemd, Helm, or development tasks. This skill teaches agents how to orchestrate CLI commands for common and complex workflows.

**Companion skill**: For creating or modifying sandbox policy YAML content (network rules, L7 inspection, access presets), use the `generate-sandbox-policy` skill. This skill covers the CLI *commands* for the policy lifecycle; `generate-sandbox-policy` covers policy *content authoring*.

**Self-teaching**: The CLI has comprehensive built-in help. When you encounter a command or option not covered in this skill, walk the help tree:

```bash
openshell --help                    # Top-level commands
openshell <group> --help            # Subcommands in a group
openshell <group> <cmd> --help      # Flags for a specific command
```

This is your primary fallback. Use it freely -- the CLI's help output is authoritative and always up-to-date.

## Prerequisites

- `openshell` is on the PATH (install via `cargo install --path crates/openshell-cli`)
- A reachable OpenShell gateway backed by Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, or the experimental VM driver
- Docker is running only when using BYOC local builds or Docker-backed development workflows
- For Kubernetes deployments: `kubectl` and Helm access to the target cluster

## Command Reference

See [cli-reference.md](cli-reference.md) for the current command tree and commonly used flags. Use it as a quick-reference, then confirm uncommon or security-sensitive options with `--help`.

---

## Workflow 1: Getting Started

Use this workflow when the user has a gateway endpoint and wants to get a sandbox running for the first time.

### Step 1: Register a gateway

```bash
openshell gateway add http://127.0.0.1:8080 --local --name local
```

Use an `http://` endpoint only for trusted local port-forwarding or a protected private path. For a gateway behind an authenticated reverse proxy, register its HTTPS endpoint with `openshell gateway add https://gateway.example.com`.

### Step 2: Verify the gateway

```bash
openshell status
openshell whoami
```

Confirm the gateway is reachable, authentication is valid or not required, and
the output shows a version. `Status: Connected` only proves the public health
endpoint is reachable; inspect the separate `Authentication` line before
running protected commands. `openshell whoami` reports the identity validated
by the gateway, including the subject an administrator uses for workspace
membership. Add `--output json` for automation.

### Step 3: Create a sandbox

The simplest way to get a sandbox running:

```bash
openshell sandbox create
```

This creates a sandbox whose canonical main process is `/bin/bash -l` and
attaches your terminal to that retained process. Add `--detach` to return after
the sandbox becomes ready without attaching.

An explicit trailing command is foreground even when stdin or stdout is not a
terminal. The CLI streams its stdout and stderr and returns its exact exit
status. Exit code 0 leaves a retained sandbox in `Completed`; nonzero leaves it
in `Error` with `MainProcessFailed`. Use `--no-keep` to delete either result
after output drains, or `--detach` for a long-running service.

When supplying `--name`, use a portable DNS-1123 label: at most 63 lowercase alphanumeric or `-` characters, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character. The Kubernetes driver rejects uppercase letters, underscores, dots, and other names that cannot become Kubernetes resource labels.

**Shortcut for known tools**: When the trailing command is a recognized tool, the CLI auto-creates the required provider from local credentials:

```bash
openshell sandbox create -- claude        # Auto-creates claude provider
openshell sandbox create -- codex         # Auto-creates codex provider
```

The agent will be prompted interactively if credentials are missing.

### Step 4: Exit and clean up

Exit the sandbox shell (`exit` or Ctrl-D), then:

```bash
openshell sandbox delete <name>
```

---

## Workflow 2: Provider Management

Providers supply credentials and provider-specific configuration to sandboxes. Provider types come from built-in and custom profiles; do not rely on a hard-coded type list. Discover the profiles available on the selected gateway:

```bash
openshell provider list-profiles
openshell provider list-profiles --output json
```

### Create a provider from local credentials

```bash
openshell provider create --name my-github --type github --from-existing
```

The `--from-existing` flag discovers credentials from local state (e.g., `gh auth` tokens, Claude config files).

### Create a provider with explicit credentials

```bash
openshell provider create --name my-api --type generic \
  --credential API_KEY \
  --config base_url=https://api.example.com
```

Bare `KEY` reads the value from the environment variable of that name and avoids placing the secret in shell history. Use `KEY=VALUE` only when the user explicitly accepts that exposure.

Other credential sources are `--from-gcloud-adc` for compatible profiles and `--runtime-credentials` when the gateway or sandbox resolves the required credentials at runtime.

Static provider credentials resolve only for hosts, ports, and paths declared by
the provider profile. Use `provider profile export` to inspect that boundary
when a placeholder is present but requests receive
`credential_endpoint_mismatch`. A profileless static provider fails closed
because the gateway cannot construct a binding.

When an inspected request receives `request_authority_mismatch`, compare its
HTTP authority with the CONNECT tunnel endpoint. The host and effective port
must match. For a tunnel to `api.example.com:8443`, send
`Host: api.example.com:8443`; `Host: api.example.com` omits the non-default
port and is rejected. An absolute-form request target must use the same
authority.

Profile-backed provider policy composition is controlled by the gateway-global
`providers_v2_enabled` setting. Static credential endpoint binding remains
active even when policy composition is disabled:

```bash
openshell settings get --global
openshell settings set --global --key providers_v2_enabled --value true
```

### Inspect and manage provider profiles

```bash
openshell provider profile export github --output yaml
openshell provider profile lint --file ./my-profile.yaml
openshell provider profile import --file ./my-profile.yaml
```

### List, inspect, update, delete

```bash
openshell provider list
openshell provider list --output json
openshell provider get my-github
openshell provider update my-github --from-existing
openshell provider delete my-github
```

`provider update` does not take `--type`. It updates credentials, config, or credential expiry on the existing provider.

### Configure credential refresh

Use refresh commands only when the provider profile and gateway support refreshable credentials:

```bash
openshell provider refresh status my-outlook
openshell provider refresh configure my-outlook \
  --credential-key MS_GRAPH_ACCESS_TOKEN \
  --strategy oauth2-refresh-token \
  --secret-material-env REFRESH_TOKEN=MS_GRAPH_REFRESH_TOKEN \
  --credential-expires-at 2026-07-16T00:00:00Z
openshell provider refresh rotate my-outlook --credential-key MS_GRAPH_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Prefer `--secret-material-env KEY[=ENVVAR]` for secret refresh material. `--material KEY=VALUE` is for non-secret material; `--secret-material-key` marks supplied material keys as secret.

The gateway stores secret refresh material through its active credential driver.
With Vault selected, refresh tokens, client secrets, and private keys live in
Vault alongside injectable provider credentials; refresh state contains only
opaque handles. A credential-backend read or write failure makes refresh fail
closed rather than falling back to inline storage. Before OpenShell 0.1.0, the
gateway does not migrate legacy inline refresh material or move secrets between
credential backends. Reconfigure affected grants after upgrading, and remove or
reconfigure credentials while the original backend remains available before
changing backends. Do not run mixed gateway versions against the same refresh
records.

Gateway-managed refresh credentials use an identity-stable workload handle.
Routine automatic refresh and `provider refresh rotate` update the access token
behind that handle, so long-running processes do not need to restart. Running
processes must be restarted once when upgrading from revision-scoped
placeholders. A later `provider refresh configure` call is an explicit
reauthorization boundary: it revokes the previous handle, and processes holding
that handle fail closed until restarted.

While gateway-managed refresh is configured, `provider update --credential`
cannot replace or delete the refresh-owned primary credential or any co-minted
output. Use `provider refresh rotate`, reconfigure refresh, or delete refresh
before returning those keys to manual management. Unrelated provider fields
remain updateable.

When OAuth refresh fails, inspect the `RECOVERY` and `FAILURE_CODE` columns from
`provider refresh status`; do not infer the remedy from HTTP status or parse
`LAST_ERROR`. `retry` means the worker will try again, `reauthorize` means the
user must obtain a new OAuth grant and run `provider refresh configure`,
`fix_configuration` means an operator must repair the OAuth client, scopes, or
administrator policy, and `investigate` means the issuer returned an
unrecognized response. The gateway parks `reauthorize` records until a manual
rotate or reconfiguration. It retries
`fix_configuration` records hourly so externally repaired configuration can
recover without rapid token-endpoint traffic. The existing access credential
remains usable only until its recorded expiry.

---

## Workflow 3: Sandbox Lifecycle

### Create with options

```bash
openshell sandbox create \
  --name my-sandbox \
  --provider my-github \
  --provider my-claude \
  --policy ./my-policy.yaml \
  --upload .:/workspace \
  --label team=agents \
  -- claude
```

Key flags:
- `--provider`: Attach configured credential providers for API keys, tokens, and other secrets (repeatable)
- `--policy`: Custom policy YAML (otherwise uses built-in default or `OPENSHELL_SANDBOX_POLICY` env var)
- `--gpu [COUNT]`: Request the driver's default GPU selection or a specific GPU count
- `--cpu`, `--memory`: Set per-sandbox compute sizing. Docker/Podman apply limits; Kubernetes applies matching requests and limits.
- `--driver-config-json`: Pass experimental driver-specific sandbox configuration
- `--label KEY=VALUE`: Add labels for later selection (repeatable)
- `--env KEY=VALUE`: Set non-secret sandbox environment variables (repeatable); use `--provider` for credentials
- `--tty`: Allocate a retained PTY for the canonical main process
- `--approval-mode manual|auto`: Control handling of agent-authored policy proposals; `manual` is the default
- `--upload <PATH>[:<DEST>]`: Upload local files into the container working directory or an explicit destination
- `--no-git-ignore`: Disable `.gitignore` filtering for uploads
- `--no-keep`: Delete the sandbox after main output and the exit result drain
- `--detach`: Start the canonical main process without attaching
- `--forward [BIND_ADDRESS:]PORT`: Forward a local port and keep the sandbox alive
- `--editor vscode|cursor`: Open a remote editor after creation and keep the sandbox alive

`--detach` adds no attachment grace period. When the canonical process exits,
its terminal phase is reported immediately. A foreground create declares one
expected main-process SSH attachment; cleanup finalizes after that connection
closes naturally.

Do not combine `--upload` with a trailing main command. Uploads currently finish
after the canonical process starts; create a scratch sandbox and use
`sandbox exec`, or build the files into the image.

### List and inspect sandboxes

```bash
openshell sandbox list
openshell sandbox list --selector team=agents --output json
openshell sandbox get my-sandbox
```

Most commands with an optional sandbox name use the last-used sandbox. Pass an explicit name in automation.

### Connect to a running sandbox

```bash
openshell sandbox connect my-sandbox
openshell sandbox connect my-sandbox --editor vscode
```

Attaches to the sandbox's existing canonical main process. Disconnecting leaves
that process running; reconnecting targets the same process instance and replays
recent output. Use `sandbox exec --tty -- /bin/bash -l` for a new shell. Press
`Ctrl-P`, then `Ctrl-Q` to disconnect without terminating main. `Ctrl-C` retains
its normal terminal behavior and interrupts the foreground process. Configure
VS Code Remote-SSH with:

```bash
openshell sandbox ssh-config my-sandbox >> ~/.ssh/config
```

### Upload and download files

```bash
# Upload local files to the sandbox working directory
openshell sandbox upload my-sandbox ./src

# Download a path relative to the sandbox working directory
openshell sandbox download my-sandbox output ./local-output
```

Uploads honor `.gitignore` by default. Add `--no-git-ignore` only when ignored files are intentionally in scope.

Uploads preserve symlinks, including dangling symlinks, instead of dereferencing their targets. A symlink source bypasses Git-aware filtering so the link itself is archived.

When the upload destination is omitted, the CLI discovers the remote working
directory. Uploading a named directory merges it into an existing directory of
the same name, overwriting matching entries without deleting unrelated entries.
Downloads accept paths relative to that working directory or absolute paths
within it.

### Execute a non-interactive command

```bash
openshell sandbox exec --name my-sandbox --workdir /workspace -- ls -la
openshell sandbox exec --name my-sandbox --env MODE=test -- cargo test
```

`sandbox exec` starts an independent sibling process, streams output, and exits
with the remote command's exit code. Use `sandbox connect` to attach to the
canonical main process.
Use `--env` only for non-secret values. Attach credentials to the sandbox with a
provider instead of passing API keys, tokens, or other secrets to `sandbox exec`.

### Change attached providers

```bash
openshell sandbox provider list my-sandbox
openshell sandbox provider attach my-sandbox my-github
openshell sandbox provider detach my-sandbox my-github
```

### View logs

```bash
# Recent logs
openshell logs my-sandbox

# Stream live logs
openshell logs my-sandbox --tail

# Filter by source and level
openshell logs my-sandbox --tail --source sandbox --level warn

# Logs from the last 5 minutes
openshell logs my-sandbox --since 5m
```

### Delete sandboxes

```bash
openshell sandbox delete my-sandbox
openshell sandbox delete sandbox-1 sandbox-2 sandbox-3   # Multiple at once
openshell sandbox delete --all
```

### Stop and start sandboxes

Use stop to halt compute while retaining the sandbox and its persistent
workspace:

```bash
openshell sandbox stop [name]
openshell sandbox start [name]
```

Both commands default to the last-used sandbox. Stop stops background
forwards and waits for `Stopped`; start waits for `Ready`. Connect, exec,
file transfer, forwarding, and exposed services are unavailable while
stopped or completed. Starting a retained `Completed` or
`Error/MainProcessFailed` sandbox launches a fresh canonical-main instance and
invalidates SSH sessions from the previous runtime generation. Delete remains
the operation that removes retained state.

---

## Workflow 4: Policy Iteration Loop

This is the most important multi-step workflow. It enables a tight feedback cycle where sandbox policy is refined based on observed activity.

**Key concept**: Policies have static fields (immutable after creation: `filesystem_policy`, `landlock`, `process`) and two dynamic fields: `network_policies` and `network_middlewares`. Both dynamic fields can be updated without recreating the sandbox when the selected compute driver supports live policy updates. MXC rejects live policy replacement and merge updates; delete and recreate an MXC sandbox instead.

An endpoint with omitted `protocol` retains explicit-proxy behavior. Explicit
`protocol: tcp` requests policy DNS and transparent TCP and currently requires
the Docker or Podman runtime; unsupported runtimes reject the policy before starting the
workload rather than activating only part of the network contract.

        ▼                          │
  Verify reload succeeded ─────────┘
```

### Step 1: Create sandbox with initial policy

```bash
openshell sandbox create --name dev --policy ./initial-policy.yaml -- claude
```

Sandboxes stay alive by default for iteration. Add `--no-keep` only when the sandbox should be deleted automatically after the initial session.

### Step 2: Monitor logs for denied actions

In a separate terminal or as the agent:

```bash
openshell logs dev --tail --source sandbox
```

Look for log lines with `action: deny` -- these indicate blocked network requests. The logs include:
- **Destination host and port** (what was blocked)
- **Binary path** (which process attempted the connection)
- **Deny reason** (why it was blocked)

### Step 3: Pull the current policy

```bash
openshell policy get dev --full > current-policy.yaml
```

The `--full` flag includes the effective policy, including provider-composed entries. Use `--base` instead when the editable base policy is needed without provider-composed entries. Before resubmitting a `--full` result, review composed entries and prefer incremental updates or the base policy when appropriate.

### Step 4: Modify the policy

Edit `current-policy.yaml` to allow the blocked actions. **For policy content authoring, delegate to the `generate-sandbox-policy` skill.** That skill handles:
- Network endpoint rule structure
- L4 vs REST, WebSocket, JSON-RPC, MCP, and SQL L7 policy decisions
- Access presets (`read-only`, `read-write`, `full`)
- TLS termination configuration
- Enforcement modes (`audit` vs `enforce`)
- Binary matching patterns
- Ordered `network_middlewares`, host selection, HTTP and WebSocket bindings, and `fail_open` or `fail_closed` behavior

`network_policies` and `network_middlewares` can be modified at runtime when the selected compute driver supports live policy updates. MXC rejects live policy replacement and merge updates; delete and recreate an MXC sandbox instead. If `filesystem_policy`, `landlock`, or `process` need changes, the sandbox must be recreated. Built-in middleware such as `openshell/regex` needs no gateway registration. An operator-run middleware must already be registered under `[[openshell.supervisor.middleware]]`; changing that static registration requires a gateway restart.

Middleware can inspect parsed HTTP request bodies and complete client-to-upstream WebSocket text messages over both `ws://` and `wss://` when the implementation advertises the matching binding. The built-in `openshell/regex` advertises both bindings and applies its fixed patterns to UTF-8 text. A host-matched HTTP-only attachment can inspect the upgrade GET but does not join the WebSocket chain; look for `binding_not_selected` coverage. Binary messages pass under both `on_error` modes and active stages emit `unsupported_message_type` coverage; upstream-to-client messages remain uninspected. A broken fail-open WebSocket stage is disabled for the rest of that connection; inspect sandbox OCSF logs for `openshell.middleware.websocket_stage_disabled`.

### Step 5: Push the updated policy

```bash
openshell policy set dev --policy current-policy.yaml --wait
```

The gateway validates the complete effective candidate—including attached
provider-profile policy—before it stores a direct update, incremental merge,
approved proposal, provider attachment, or profile update that affects attached
sandboxes. An ambiguity failure returns `FAILED_PRECONDITION`; the rejected
candidate does not create a policy revision or partially update affected
sandboxes. The same fail-closed response applies when `credential_signing`
does not have an attached AWS profile whose credential boundary covers the
endpoint, or an explicit binding to an endpointless AWS profile. Fix the
conflicting endpoint selectors or credential source and submit again.

The `--wait` flag blocks until the sandbox confirms the policy is loaded (polls every second). Exit codes:
- **0**: Policy loaded successfully
- **1**: Policy load failed
- **124**: Timeout (default 60 seconds)

### Step 6: Verify the update

```bash
openshell policy list dev
```

Check that the latest revision shows status `loaded`. If `failed`, check the error column for details.

### Step 7: Repeat

Return to Step 2. Continue monitoring logs and refining the policy until all required actions are allowed and no unnecessary permissions exist.

### Policy revision history

View all revisions to understand how the policy evolved:

```bash
openshell policy list dev --limit 50
```

Fetch a specific historical revision:

```bash
openshell policy get dev --rev 3 --full
```

Gateway-global policy commands use `--global` and require confirmation unless `--yes` is supplied:

```bash
openshell policy get --global --full
openshell policy set --global --policy ./global-policy.yaml
openshell policy list --global
openshell policy delete --global
```

Avoid `--yes` during interactive work. A global policy locks policy control for all sandboxes on the gateway.

### Review agent-authored rule proposals

Sandboxes created with `--approval-mode manual` place every proposal in the review inbox. `auto` approves only valid effective-policy candidates with an empty prover delta; findings still require review. The CLI binds approval to the candidate's current review token. If live policy, provider, or credential inputs change, approval leaves the chunk pending with a refreshed candidate and requires a fresh review.

```bash
openshell rule get dev --status pending
openshell rule approve dev --chunk-id <chunk-id>
openshell rule reject dev --chunk-id <chunk-id> --reason "too broad"
openshell rule history dev
```

Review the proposed scope, candidate hash, prover findings, and application errors before approval. Treat `rule approve-all --include-security-flagged` as a high-risk bulk action.

---

## Workflow 5: BYOC (Bring Your Own Container)

Build a custom container image and run it as a sandbox.

### Create a sandbox from a Dockerfile

```bash
openshell sandbox create --from ./Dockerfile --name my-app
```

The `--from` flag accepts a Dockerfile path, a directory containing a Dockerfile, a full image reference such as `myregistry.com/img:tag`, or a community sandbox name such as `ollama`.

Local Dockerfile and directory builds require a local gateway because the CLI builds through the local Docker daemon. Use a registry image reference for remote gateways. Bare community names resolve under `ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell-community/sandboxes` unless `OPENSHELL_COMMUNITY_REGISTRY` overrides the prefix.

For Docker and Podman gateways, custom images should declare a non-root OCI
`USER`. Each explicit `process.run_as_user` or `process.run_as_group` policy
field wins independently; omitted fields fall back to the image declaration.
An image with no `USER` fails before readiness unless policy supplies both
fields. Explicit numeric fields may use any UID/GID from `1` through
`4294967294`; `0` is root and `4294967295` is the invalid identity sentinel.
Warn users that low IDs can inherit permissions from matching accounts, image
files, mounted volumes, or devices.

### Forward ports

```bash
# Foreground (blocks)
openshell forward start 8080 my-app

# Background (returns immediately)
openshell forward start 8080 my-app -d
```

The service is now reachable at `localhost:8080`.

Manage or iterate on the sandbox:

```bash
openshell forward list
openshell forward stop 8080 my-app
openshell sandbox delete my-app
openshell sandbox create --from ./Dockerfile --name my-app --forward 8080
```

Create and forward in one command:

```bash
openshell sandbox create --from ./Dockerfile --forward 8080 -- ./start-server.sh
```

The `--forward` flag starts a background port forward before the command runs.

## Workflow 6: Agent-Assisted Sandbox Session

Support a human working in a sandbox while an agent monitors activity and refines the policy in parallel.

Create the sandbox and keep it alive:

```bash
openshell sandbox create \
  --name work-session \
  --provider github \
  --provider claude \
  --policy ./dev-policy.yaml
```

Tell the user to connect in another shell:

```bash
openshell sandbox connect work-session
openshell sandbox connect work-session --editor vscode
```

Monitor denied activity:

```bash
openshell logs work-session --tail --source sandbox --level warn
```

When denied actions appear:

1. Prefer incremental updates for additive network changes:
   `openshell policy update work-session --add-endpoint api.github.com:443:read-only:rest:enforce --binary /usr/bin/gh --wait`
   `openshell policy update work-session --add-allow 'api.github.com:443:POST:/repos/*/issues' --wait`

   A rule authorizes every binary it lists to reach every endpoint it lists, so
   an update that adds a binary or an endpoint to an existing rule must declare
   that rule's whole binary and endpoint scope. The gateway rejects an update
   that would grant a binary-to-endpoint pair the update never asked for, and
   the error names the binaries still missing. To grant one binary access to
   only part of a rule's endpoints, send the narrow authorization under its own
   `--rule-name`; it stays on its own rule instead of folding into the broader
   one.

   `--add-allow` and `--add-deny` select an endpoint by host and port alone. If
   that host and port appears in more than one rule, or twice in one rule under
   different paths, the update is rejected as ambiguous. Fall back to full YAML
   replacement for those endpoints.
2. Use full YAML replacement for broad changes or non-network fields, including
   any change that would otherwise require restating a large existing scope:
   `openshell policy get work-session --full > policy.yaml`
   Modify the policy with the `generate-sandbox-policy` skill.
   `openshell policy set work-session --policy policy.yaml --wait`
3. Verify with `openshell policy list work-session`.

The user does not need to disconnect. Policy updates are hot-reloaded; `--wait` blocks until the sandbox confirms the revision or the timeout expires. Delete the sandbox when the session ends:

```bash
openshell sandbox delete work-session
```

## Workflow 7: Managed Inference

Configure the user-facing `inference.local` route or the system inference route used by platform functions.

Ensure the provider exists, then set the route:

```bash
openshell provider list
openshell inference set \
  --provider nvidia \
  --model nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b
```

This updates the managed `inference.local` route. Endpoint verification runs before the route is saved. Use `--no-verify` only when verification is intentionally impossible, and use `--timeout SECONDS` to configure the request timeout. Add `--system` to `set` or `update` for the platform-only system route.

Inspect both configurations:

```bash
openshell inference get
openshell inference get --system
```

Agents send HTTPS requests to `inference.local`; the sandbox intercepts them and routes them through the configured inference route. Sandbox policy remains separate from inference route configuration.

## Workflow 8: Gateway Management

List, switch, and verify gateways:

```bash
openshell gateway select
openshell gateway list --output json
openshell gateway select production
openshell gateway info --name production
openshell status
```

Register or remove gateways:

```bash
openshell gateway add http://127.0.0.1:8080 --local --name local
openshell gateway add https://gateway.example.com --name production
openshell gateway remove local
```

`https://` registrations default to edge authentication. Use `gateway login` and `gateway logout` to refresh or clear stored authentication. For an OIDC gateway, supply `--oidc-issuer` and, when needed, `--oidc-client-id`, `--oidc-audience`, and `--oidc-scopes`. For remote mTLS gateways, use `--remote USER@HOST` or an `ssh://` endpoint.

For one-off automation, `--gateway-endpoint URL` connects directly without stored metadata. Limit `--gateway-insecure` to explicitly trusted development endpoints.

Inspect a Kubernetes deployment:

```bash
helm -n openshell status openshell
kubectl -n openshell get deployment,statefulset,pods,svc
kubectl -n openshell logs deployment/openshell -c openshell-gateway --tail=100
kubectl -n openshell logs statefulset/openshell -c openshell-gateway --tail=100
```

For Docker, Podman, and VM-backed gateways, inspect the gateway process or container logs and the selected runtime directly.

## Workflow 9: Settings Management

Manage sandbox-scoped or gateway-global settings:

```bash
openshell settings get work-session
openshell settings set work-session --key ocsf_json_enabled --value true
openshell settings delete work-session --key ocsf_json_enabled

openshell settings get --global --json
openshell settings set --global --key providers_v2_enabled --value true
```

Global mutations prompt for confirmation. Use `--yes` only in reviewed automation.

`policy_validation_failure_mode` is gateway startup configuration, not a
mutable `openshell settings` key. Set it under `[openshell.gateway]` in
`gateway.toml` and restart the gateway. The security-first default is
`fail_closed`; `retain_last_valid` is an explicit availability tradeoff. OCSF
configuration events state whether the previous generation is active after a
runtime validation failure.

## Workflow 10: Service Access

Use `forward` for local access and `service` for a gateway-managed HTTP endpoint:

```bash
# SSH-based same-port forwarding; optional bind address is accepted.
openshell forward start 127.0.0.1:8080 my-app -d

# gRPC relay to a loopback TCP service, with an optional dynamic local port.
openshell forward service my-app --target-port 8000 --local 127.0.0.1:0

# Expose and manage an HTTP service through the gateway.
openshell service expose my-app 8080 web
openshell service list my-app
openshell service get my-app web
openshell service delete my-app web
```

Prefer loopback binds unless the user explicitly needs LAN-visible local access.

## Self-Teaching via `--help`

When you encounter a command or option not covered in this skill:

1. **Start broad**: `openshell --help` to see all command groups.
2. **Narrow down**: `openshell <group> --help` to see subcommands (e.g., `openshell sandbox --help`).
3. **Get specific**: `openshell <group> <cmd> --help` for flags and usage (e.g., `openshell sandbox create --help`).

The CLI help is always authoritative. If the help output contradicts this skill, follow the help output -- the CLI may have been updated since this skill was written.

### Example: discovering an unfamiliar command

```bash
$ openshell sandbox --help
# Shows: create, get, list, stop, start, delete, exec, connect, upload, download, ssh-config, provider

$ openshell sandbox upload --help
# Shows: positional arguments (name, path, dest), usage examples
```
